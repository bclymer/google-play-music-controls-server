google-play-music-controls-server
=================================

Go server for controlling Google Play Music globally. Requires more than just this. Check my repos.

You will also need the [Chrome Extension](https://github.com/bclymer/google-play-music-controls-extension) and [AutoHotKey script](https://gist.github.com/bclymer/11196199)

This project is no longer maintained. Chrome added support for global hotkeys, and the Google Play Music app for Chrome added support to customize global hotkeys for prev/play/next, so I'm just using that now.
